# Used Car Price Prediction

This project provides a web application to predict the price of used cars based on various features. The application is built using Flask and leverages a machine learning model trained on a dataset of used car specifications.

## Features

**User-friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive web form allows users to input car details for price prediction.
**Comprehensive Input Fields:** Predict car prices based on:
    * Car Name
    * Brand
    * Model
    * Vehicle Age (Years)
    * Kilometers Driven
    * Number of Seats
    * Seller Type
    * Fuel Type
    * Transmission
    * Mileage (km/l)
    * Engine (CC)
    * Max Power (BHP)
**Machine Learning Powered:** Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.
